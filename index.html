        <p>Fall is my favorite season and time of year by far. I love New England and it really feels like this part of the country was made especially for me. The heat and mosquitos have gone, which means I can finally venture outside again. The season usually kicks off with a lovely apple picking excursion. There's a great orchard near my house that sells cider donuts by the bucket. The foliage is wonderful and I don't mind sharing the roads with the hordes of Massachusetts and Connecticut drivers during this fleeting window of time. I love Halloween and trick-or-treating with my daughter. Stephen King is my favorite storyteller and I love horror movies. Almost everything about this time of year is magical...almost everything.</p>
  
        <p>Thanksgiving is almost always bad. A stain on an otherwise perfect time of year. If you find yourself in the unfortunate position of hosting this terrible event, you'll find nothing but fear and panic occupying your mental space for the majority of the day. At least that's been my annual observation of these poor masochists. Wondering if the people they've invited will show and when they don't, it inevitably gets taken as a personal slight. Ironically, these uncomfortable vibrations are inevitably felt by the guests that end up attending this freakshow.</p>
  
        <p>The people that do claim to enjoy this day almost always cite the food as a high watermark. They must be twisted on drugs. By the time you have your plate and everyone else has theirs—depending on how many others you're waiting on to shuffle through the line—everything is almost always cold or lukewarm at best. The turkey is usually dry and flavorless. The mashed potatoes are starting to get dense and deflated. All this serves to accomplish is leaving me longing for a real meal.</p>

        <p>I haven't enjoyed watching football in a long time and find the NFL to be a particularly despicable organization worthy of boycott, but that's for another article.</p>

        <p>My favorite Thanksgiving will always be the one during the first year of COVID. We had just moved into our house earlier that week. My parents had offered to take our daughter for the evening. We were "social distancing" so there was no risk of encountering another human. My wife and I shared a lovely meal together on our tiny 3 by 2 foot dining table surrounded by moving boxes. The food was hot and delicious.</p>
